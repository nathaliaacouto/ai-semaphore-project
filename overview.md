# Traffic Management System Technical Documentation

## Overview

The provided Python code implements a Traffic Management System, introducing additional features such as traffic flow optimization, disruption prediction, and handling emergency vehicles. This documentation aims to provide an in-depth understanding of each component and functionality within the system.

## TrafficLight Class

The `TrafficLight` class encapsulates the behavior of a traffic light. It maintains two crucial properties:

- `color`: Represents the current state of the traffic light (Green, Yellow, Red).
- `time`: Denotes the duration of each traffic light state.

The `change_color` method allows the traffic light to transition between states, adhering to the typical sequence of Green -> Yellow -> Red. The `change_time` method enables dynamic adjustment of the time duration for each state.

## Vehicle Class

The `Vehicle` class represents vehicles within the system. Key properties include:

- `waiting_time`: Tracks the time a vehicle spends waiting at a red light.
- `position`: Specifies the current position of the vehicle.

The class provides methods such as `stop` to notify the vehicle about a red light and `request_green_light` to initiate a green light request if the waiting time surpasses a predefined threshold.

## RoadSign Class

The `RoadSign` class defines the characteristics of road signs. It primarily features:

- `sign_type`: Indicates the type of road sign associated with an intersection.

## Lane Class

The `Lane` class represents individual lanes within a road. It comprises:

- `lane_id`: Identifies the lane.
- `vehicles`: A list to store vehicle instances within the lane.

The `add_vehicle` method facilitates the addition of new vehicles to the lane.

## Road Class

The `Road` class models a road within the system. It includes:

- `name`: A label for the road.
- `lanes`: A list of lanes associated with the road.

## Intersection Class

The `Intersection` class models traffic intersections. Its properties consist of:

- `name`: A unique identifier for the intersection.
- `traffic_light`: An instance of the `TrafficLight` class.
- `road_sign`: An instance of the `RoadSign` class.
- `road`: An instance of the `Road` class, representing a road associated with the intersection.

The class incorporates methods such as `change_road_sign` to adjust the road sign based on the traffic light color and `check_change_with_time` to determine if the traffic light should change.

## CentralCoordinationAgent Class

The `CentralCoordinationAgent` class serves as a coordinator for optimizing traffic flow. Key attributes include:

- `intersections`: A list of intersections to be coordinated.

The `optimize_traffic_flow` method implements logic to adjust traffic light timings based on traffic conditions. It iterates over intersections, modifying timings, and communicates with other agents for improved traffic flow.

## DisruptionManagementAgent Class

The `DisruptionManagementAgent` class handles disruption prediction. It features:

- `predict_disruptions` method: Utilizes a placeholder machine learning model for disruption prediction. If disruption probability exceeds a threshold, it alerts relevant agents and adjusts traffic light timings.

## EmergencyVehicleAgent Class

The `EmergencyVehicleAgent` class manages emergency vehicles. It comprises:

- `request_priority` method: Initiates a priority request for emergency vehicles. If an emergency condition is detected, it communicates with traffic light agents to grant priority.

## Environment Class

The `Environment` class orchestrates the overall system. Key properties include:

- `roads`: A list of roads within the environment.
- `intersections`: A list of intersections within the environment.
- `central_agent`: An instance of the `CentralCoordinationAgent` class.
- `disruption_agent`: An instance of the `DisruptionManagementAgent` class.
- `emergency_agent`: An instance of the `EmergencyVehicleAgent` class.

The class includes methods like `add_road` and `add_intersection` for extending the environment. The `display` method showcases information about roads, lanes, intersections, and invokes additional functionalities.

## Conclusion

This Traffic Management System provides a modular and extensible framework for handling various aspects of traffic control, disruption prediction, and emergency scenarios. It includes well-defined classes with encapsulated functionalities, promoting maintainability and scalability. The placeholder logic enables further customization based on specific use cases.
